### Photo Gallery Project

The repository is a photo gallery website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website displays a collection of photos in a grid layout, allowing users to click on individual photos to view them in a larger size.

This project was built as part of the [Launch School](https://launchschool.com) course JS230 and [can be viewed live via Github pages here](https://westonludeke.github.io/photo_gallery/).
